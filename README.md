CTV / ToxValue.org Random Forest Model - batch mode code for Windows

This code allows one to run the ToxValue.org code in batch mode 
on a Windows machine (get_ad.exe is a Windows executable).  
An example input file with CAS numbers, SMILES, and molecular 
weights is included.  The R script implements the code.
